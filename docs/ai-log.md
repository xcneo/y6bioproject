## Claude Code task summaries

- 2026-08-14 — Updated `CLAUDE.md`: added the standard Claude Code header, an npm commands
  section, and a "current state" section recording that Tailwind and react-router-dom are
  named in the spec but not yet installed, and that `src/App.jsx` is still the stock Vite
  starter. Created this log file.
- 2026-08-14 — Installed Tailwind CSS v4 (via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin) and
  react-router-dom v7. Replaced the stock Vite starter page in `src/App.jsx` with a
  plain Tailwind-styled heading to confirm the setup works; deleted the now-unused
  `src/App.css`. Updated the Stack section of `CLAUDE.md` to match.
- 2026-08-14 — Built the Neighbourhood Dashboard (feature 1) for Clementi: stylised SVG
  map with 15 mock facilities, filter chips by type, tap-a-marker detail card with a
  "report a problem" form, nearest-first list, events with join/volunteer buttons,
  points counter, and the neighbourhood sustainability score ranking six estates.
  Added a three-tab bottom nav with the Share and Impact screens as placeholders.
  Chose one estate in depth over a Singapore-wide map — see the note in `facilities.js`.
- 2026-08-14 — Changed how event points work. Points are now credited only when
  attendance is confirmed, not when you sign up, so volunteering can be cancelled
  with nothing to claw back and nobody can farm points from events they skip.
  Events now move through sign-up → attended, and `events.js` gained past events
  so the attendance step is visible in the demo. Renamed `pointsForJoining` to
  `pointsForAttending`. Also changed the demo resident's name to Henrison.
